# Patched Exploits Overview
Some NitroType vulnerabilities I found while screwing around with JS in early-mid 2020.

## `/api/race/save-qualifying`
Probably the most abusable endpoint in NitroType history has been the v2 endpoint for setting qualifying races.

**Parameters** (at the time): `carID`, `speed`, `uhash`.

### WPM Exploit
It was possible to reach the Uint32 max value by sending a fake request with a manipulated `speed` param.

### Cash Exploit
By repeatedly injecting and selling cars at millisecond intervals it was possible to billions of generate NT cash.

### Race Exploit
At the end of each race, the WPM could be reset to 5. Thus, if you were a fast typer each race would take less than **5 seconds** with nitros.

## Zombie Racers
Race starting times could be drastically decreased by running many instances of "zombie racers". They'd join a race long enough to begin, disqualify, and then join another race.

## Python Ports
